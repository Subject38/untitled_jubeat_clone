# Untitled Jubeat Clone
This is a project that I have been wanting to work on for a very long time now.
It is heavily inspired by [jubeat analyser](http://yosh52.web.fc2.com/) and 
[jujube](https://gitlab.com/square-game-liberation-front/jujube/). 

The current goal of the project is to reach feature parity with jujube and
I'm splitting off from that project because I don't want to build on top of
the admittedly messy C++ codebase due to being rather inexperienced with C++
as well as not much of an enjoyer of its quirks. It also is an essentially
abandoned project for the time being. My intention with this project
is to have a jubeat simulator/clone that can work on the original hardware
without lag and serve as a legitimate replacement for running the real software
on that machine. I have already done experiements with jujube to get it running
on official hardware and it does work, but I'm unhappy with the state of that project
and the original maintainer of it has stated that it would be easier to start from scratch
at this point than to continue working on it. So I'm left here starting a brand new project
without a clue of what I'm doing and only a prayer that I can learn enough to create something
cool. So right now, I want what is essentially a barebones reimplementation of the features that
already exist in that game, as well as a few additions. I would like to have scoretracking and
native arcade machine IO support. Once those have been completed, I have some stretch goals in mind
that are best left unstated due to how early in development this project is. The name is an obvious
ripoff of [unnamed-sdvx-clone](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone). I might even change
the name if this project makes any amount of progress at all though. Who knows! I'm just a man
with a dream and hopefully enough spare time to make it come to life.
